      <description>Predicting 2020 Presidential Elections
Link to Github Repository
Modelling US presidential elections, in particular, is especially difficult due to the lack of example elections, as there have only been 58 presidential elections in the history of the US. This problem is exacerbated by the unique circumstances surrounding the 2020 election, largely due to the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though only three incumbent presidents have lost in the last 100 years, President Trump is facing growing scrutiny for his response (or lack thereof) to the pandemic and its impact on the economy and the welfare of American citizens, and Joe Biden has maintained a consistent lead over incumbent President Trump in opinion polls before the election [1].</description>
